# Mix-Or-Match
Here is the link for playing the game [*Mix-Or-Match*](https://madhura-3.github.io/Mix-Or-Match/). :tada:

 - To get started with what is  **Javascript Programming** I implemented  this small memory game called Mix-Or-Match. :video_game:
 - Used Audio sounds for **_victory, gameover, flip, match and as background music_**. :musical_score:
 - Used **Fisher-Yates Algorithm** for shuffling the card/tiles of this memory game.
 - **Timer and No. of Flips**  counts is also implemented to make it more fun! :smile:
